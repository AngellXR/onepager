We believe these types of projects represent the greatest chance of success in the Metaverse landscape, as well as the highest profit potential for our investors.</p></section><section class="section"><h2>Interoperability is an unprecendented driver of profitabilty, potential, and scale.</h2><p>Interoperability isn’t just important, it’s crucial to the manifestation of the Metaverse. Interoperability protocols unlock new potential for Metaverse creators and consumers, and the first Metaverse platforms that achieve widespread adoption will leverage interoperability to achieve their vision.</p></section><section class="section"><h2>We seek to unlock Founder potential, with a proven system.</h2><p>Today, founders must choose to build within established ecosystems, which limits their potential. We believe in funding founders who are creating beyond the walls of these empires, by building bridges in, and across the Metaverse. Through funding, mentorship, and exposure, we can create an ideal space for founders to reach their full potential.</p></section><section class="section"><h2>You don’t have to go it alone</h2><p>We understand the industry, and have built relationships with a variety of partners who share our hypothesis: Interoperability unlocks the potential of the Metaverse, on-and-off-chain. By embracing this ideal, we know we can find and fund Metaverse projects with a clear path towards limitless growth and potential.</p></section><section class="section"><h2>PLACEHOLDER FOOTER</h2></section></body></html>
